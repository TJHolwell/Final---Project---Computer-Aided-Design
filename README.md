**Software:** SolidWorks, MATLAB  

## Project Overview
This project redesigns a centrifugal pump impeller to improve flow efficiency and reduce stress concentrations, using CAD modeling and basic simulation.

## Objectives
- Improve flow efficiency through blade geometry optimization
- Monitor stress concentrations through design improvements
- Explore material options for durability and performance

## Design Process
1. Imported original impeller model
2. Redesigned blade curvature and thickness to increase pump efficiency 
3. Apply fillets to reduce stress points
4. Conducted stress and/or flow analysis to test design
